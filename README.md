## TooDo  - A wall of messages app

The "Wall of Messages" is a full-stack web application built using NodeJS, Express, React, Typescript, Tailwind, and a MySQL database. NodeJS is a lightweight and scalable JavaScript runtime environment used for building the web server. The app provides a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for users to post and read messages on a wall. The data is stored in a MySQL database, and the clean and modern user interface is built using React and styled with Tailwind. Typescript is used to add static typing and interfaces for easier development and maintenance. The combination of these technologies provides a fast, scalable, and reliable user experience.
